war thunder Wiki client for Android. very WIP

PS keep this a secret, but.... i am totally using my old UI from MLand. i converted it to Material Design 3 and am currently updating the UI to have all of those modern Android touches

i still need to rename the package and module to io.hifii.wt.wiki.
